## Homer Multitext project: validated editing



### Background

In 2020, the Homer Multitext project adopted a new architecture for automated validation and computer-assisted verification.  All tests extend the `edu.holycross.shot.citevalidator.CiteValidator` trait, and can be applied to any  library of citable scholarly resources that can be represented by the `edu.holycross.shot.scm.CiteLibrary` class.

To keep track of our editorial progress, it is important to assess all related material on a single manuscript.  As we begin to test (or retest) material in our published releases, we will document here the results of testing for each page of each manuscript we have worked on.


For more information, see the README for the [project github repository](https://github.com/homermultitext/scoreboard).

### Manuscripts

- Venetus A:  we completed an initial edition of the Venetus in 2018.  As we work on other manuscripts, we will revalidate our work on corresponding pages of the Venetus A, and record the results here.
- Venetus B: we began work on the Venetus B in 2019.  We expect to incorporate material from the Venetus B in published releases begining in the summer of 2020.
- Escorial, Upsilon 1.1: we began work on the Upsilon 1.1 in 2019.  We expect to incorporate material from the Upsilon 1.1 in published releases begining in the summer of 2020.
- British Library, Burney 86: we have done some preliminary work on Burney 86.  We do not yet have a firm timeline for first published releases to include material from Burney 86.


Current state of validation and verification:


- [Venetus A](./venetusA/)
- [Venetus B](./venetusB/)
- [Escorial, Upsilon 1.1](./upsilon1_1/)
- [British Library, Burney 86](./burney86/)
